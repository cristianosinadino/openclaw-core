## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### 1. Setup Your Environment

```bash
# Initialize the project with your details
./init-dao-project.sh

# Authenticate with Salesforce
sf org login web --alias msb-sbox
```

### 2. Review Source of Truth Documents

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| How agents should work | `/rules/AGENTS.md` |
| Project status | `/PROJECT.md` |
| Architecture & reusability patterns | `/docs/01-foundation/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Object names & relationships | `/docs/01-foundation/data-model.md` |
| Field mappings | `/docs/01-foundation/field-mappings.csv` (source) + `.md` (context) |
| External app workflows | `/docs/03-workflows/` |

### 3. Deploy Metadata

```bash
# Deploy custom objects
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/objects --target-org msb-sbox
```

### 4. Start Coding

See [Common Tasks](#-common-tasks) below for typical workflows.

## 🧠 Working with AI Agents

> Agents: open `/rules/AGENTS.md` before any work.

This project is optimized for AI-assisted development. The `rules/AGENTS.md` file contains comprehensive, IDE-agnostic instructions for agents.

**Key principle**: The CSV file (`field-mappings.csv`) is **USER-MAINTAINED**. Agents read it but never modify it.

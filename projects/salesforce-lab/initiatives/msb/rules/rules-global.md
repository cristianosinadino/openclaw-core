# Main Street Bank Salesforce Project - AI Agent Rules

**Version**: 3.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-11  
**Single Source of Truth**: This file contains global, IDE-agnostic rules for all AI agents

## 🎯 Project Objective (Phase 1)

**Goal**: Build LWC-based screens and supporting backend infrastructure to guide Salesforce users through the complete deposit account opening process.

**Outcomes (Phase 1)**:
- Create intuitive LWC screens for each step of the account opening process
- Build Apex services to support the LWC workflows and business logic
- Implement data validation, state management, and workflow navigation
- Optional: Integrate with external applications for data ingestion
- Lifecycle: Account Creation → Opportunity  → Application Form → Business Details  → Applicant Details → Product Selection → Role Assignments → Document Checklist  → Review & Submit → Account Funding

**This order may be alter**: We need user-friendly interfaces that guide users through the complex deposit account opening process, with robust backend services supporting the workflow. But the sequence may not always be the above. Custom metadata allow admins to re-order steps.

## 🔴 MANDATORY PRE-WORK CHECKLIST

Complete EVERY time before starting ANY task — in this order:

1. **READ** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-MASTER.md` — **START HERE**. Canonical record of every story built: system design, data model, components, configuration, constraints, and how-tos. This replaces reading the entire `docs/04-implementation/` tree.

2. **READ** `docs/rules-global.md` (this file) — Project objective, canonical object/field names, coding standards, and SOP.

3. **READ** `docs/02-requirements/backlog.md` — Active sprint scope and backlog priorities.

4. **LOAD the relevant story file** from `docs/02-requirements/` only for the specific feature/story the task touches.

5. **VERIFY API names** in `force-app/main/default/objects/` for any object or field you plan to reference or create.

6. **SCAN** the specific LWC and Apex files in `force-app/main/default/` that the task will touch — do NOT assume current state from memory.

> **Skip steps 3–6 only for purely conversational or planning-only requests.**  
> **If ANY required file is inaccessible, STOP and ask the user before proceeding.**

## 📋 Correct Object Names (FSC) - NON-NEGOTIABLE

### ✅ Use These Names (Canonical):

| Logical Name | Object Type | API Name | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **ApplicationForm** | FSC | `ApplicationForm` | Loan/deposit application |
| **Applicant** | FSC | `Applicant` | Individual applicants |
| **Account** (Business) | Standard | `Account` | Business accounts (RecordType) |
| **Account** (PersonAccount) | Standard | `Account` | Individual accounts (RecordType) |
| **FinancialAccount** | FSC | `FinServ__FinancialAccount__c` | Loan/financial account |
| **FinancialAccountRole** | FSC | `FinServ__FinancialAccountRole__c` | Account roles on financial accounts |
| **ApplicationFormProduct** | FSC | `ApplicationFormProduct` | Products on applications |
| **Product2** | Standard | `Product2` | Loan products |
| **Due_Diligence__c** | Custom | `Due_Diligence__c` | Compliance tracking |
| **Assigned_Products__c** | Custom | `Assigned_Products__c` | Applicant-Product junction |
| **Collateral__c** | Custom | `Collateral__c` | Collateral items |
| **Collateral_Owner__c** | Custom | `Collateral_Owner__c` | Collateral ownership |
| **Collateral_Association__c** | Custom | `Collateral_Association__c` | Collateral-Account association |
| **Collateral_Assessment__c** | Custom | `Collateral_Assessment__c` | Collateral valuations |
| **Task** | Standard | `Task` | Checklist items |

### ❌ NEVER Use These Incorrect Names:

- ~~`Application__c`~~ → Use `ApplicationForm`
- ~~`Application`~~ (without Form) → Use `ApplicationForm`
- ~~`Loan__c`~~ → Use `FinServ__FinancialAccount__c` or `FinancialAccount`
- ~~`Business_Relationship__c`~~ → Use `Account` (Business)
- ~~`Checklist__c`~~ → Use `Task`
- ~~`Checklist_Item__c`~~ → Use `Task`
- ~~Custom `Applicant__c`~~ → It's an FSC object, use `Applicant`

### 🔑 External ID Field Names:

**Integration:**

| Object | Field API Name | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| ApplicationForm | `DAOApplicationId__c` | Application ID |
| Applicant | `DAOApplicantId__c` | Applicant ID |
| Account | `DAOBusinessId__c` | Business ID |

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Always verify API names in `force-app/main/default/objects/` before coding.

---

## 📝 Standard Operating Procedure

Always follow these steps in order:

1. **PICK** a single backlog item from `/docs/02-requirements/backlog.md`
2. **READ** the matching story file in `/docs/02-requirements/` if applicable
3. **VERIFY** object/field names in `/docs/01-foundation/data-model.md` and `force-app/main/default/objects/`
4. **REVIEW** `docs/05-analysis/` for current implementation status
5. **IMPLEMENT** with minimal diffs; follow naming already in repo
6. **TEST** Add/adjust tests; ensure bulkification (200+ records) and CRUD/FLS
7. **DOCUMENT** If objects/fields changed:
   - Update `/docs/01-foundation/data-model.md`
   - Add session notes to `/docs/04-implementation/session-notes/`
8. **PACKAGE** Create metadata entries in `package.xml` for each new component
9. **DEPLOY** Deploy to target org and verify
10. **FINALIZE** Mark task complete in story file

---

## ✅ Task Tracking Protocol (MANDATORY)

- **Every story must include** a `Tasks and Sub-Tasks` section with actionable checkboxes.
- **Before coding:** Review the story's Tasks/Sub-Tasks. If missing or unclear, add/clarify them in the story file under `docs/02-requirements/`.
- **During work:** Update Task/Sub-Task checkboxes as progress is made. Keep them in sync with actual work.
- **On completion:** Ensure all Tasks/Sub-Tasks are checked or explicitly deferred with a note in the story.
- **Transparency:** Prefer small updates to the story over vague session notes; session notes should summarize highlights and decisions.

---

## 📄 File Creation Rules (MANDATORY)

### For Documentation Files (.md):

```markdown
<!-- 
🔴 AI AGENTS: READ FIRST - /docs/01-foundation/data-model.md for correct object names
✅ Correct: ApplicationForm, Applicant, Account (Business), FinancialAccount
❌ Wrong: Application__c, Applicant__c, Loan__c, Business_Relationship__c
-->

# [Title]
```

### For Apex Classes (.cls):

```java
/**
 * @description [Description]
 * 
 * DATA MODEL: Uses ApplicationForm, Applicant, Account, FinancialAccount
 * See /docs/01-foundation/data-model.md for complete data model
 * 
 * @author [Author]
 * @date YYYY-MM-DD
 */
public class ClassName {
    // ...
}
```

### File Types Requiring Headers:
- ✅ All .md files in `/docs/`
- ✅ All .cls (Apex classes)
- ✅ All README files
- ✅ All implementation/progress documents
- ✅ All session summaries

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Creating a file without the appropriate header is incomplete work.

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- All Apex tests must be ≥85% coverage
- Tests must be bulkified (200+ records)
- Follow test patterns in existing test classes
- Minimal test data in setup method
- Minimal assertions per test
- No DML in test methods outside of `Test.startTest()` / `Test.stopTest()`

---

## 📦 Deployment Requirements

- Update `package.xml` for ALL new components
- Deploy to target org: `sf project deploy start --source-dir [path] --target-org msb-sbox`
- Verify deployment success before marking task complete
- Update documentation after successful deployment
- Document any deployment issues in `/docs/04-implementation/session-notes/`

---

## 🎯 Code Quality Standards

- Use `with sharing` for security (unless specific reason not to)
- Check CRUD/FLS permissions before DML operations
- Bulkify all DML operations (handle 200+ records)
- Handle exceptions gracefully with try-catch
- Add meaningful debug statements for troubleshooting
- Follow existing code patterns in the repo
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add inline comments for complex logic

---

## 🏗️ Enterprise Patterns (fflib-apex-common)

When applicable, follow enterprise patterns:

- **Domain Pattern**: Business logic in Domain classes (extend `fflib_SObjectDomain`)
- **Selector Pattern**: SOQL queries in Selector classes (extend `fflib_SObjectSelector`)
- **Service Pattern**: Complex operations in Service classes
- **Unit of Work**: Use for transaction management and bulkification
- **Trigger Pattern**: Triggers only delegate to Domain classes (no business logic)

**Note**: Not all classes require fflib patterns. Use judgment based on complexity.

  - [ ] Session notes added to `/docs/04-implementation/session-notes/` (if significant work)
- [ ] Updated story file with completion status

---

## 📊 Available Reports (docs/05-analysis/)

Before starting any task, review these for current state:

- `metadata-audit-reports/` - Metadata inventory and gap analysis
- Check for implementation tracking and coverage summaries

---

## 🏷️ Work Item Prefixes

Use these prefixes in commits and documentation:

- **LWC-** = Lightning Web Components (UI screens, user experience)
- **SVC-** = Apex Services (business logic, validation, orchestration)
- **DM-** = Data Model (objects/fields/ER updates)
- **ING-** = Ingestion (parser, mapper, upsert services, tests)
- **API-** = API Development (REST endpoints, authentication, integration)
- **SEC-** = Security (FLS/CRUD, PII handling, permissions)
- **DOC-** = Documentation (ER/ADRs)

---

## 🌿 Git Workflow & Branching Strategy

**MANDATORY**: All new features and bug fixes must be developed on dedicated branches.

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive, kebab-case branch names with prefixes:

- **`feature/[description]`** — For new features (e.g., `feature/add-collateral-validation`)
- **`bugfix/[description]`** — For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-applicant-lookup`)
- **`hotfix/[description]`** — For urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- **`docs/[description]`** — For documentation-only changes (e.g., `docs/update-adr-index`)

### Branch Workflow

1. **Create Branch**: Always create a feature branch from `main` (or your default branch)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-description
   ```

2. **Document Purpose**: In your first commit or PR, include:
   - What the feature/fix does
   - Why it's needed
   - Rollback plan if something goes wrong

3. **Commit Often**: Make small, logical commits with descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add validation for collateral amount field"
   ```

4. **Pull Request**: When ready, create a PR using the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`

5. **Merge**: Only merge after:
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] Code review complete (if applicable)
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Deployed to sandbox and verified

### Rollback Strategy

Every branch/PR must document how to roll back:

**Option 1: Revert the merge commit**
```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```

**Option 2: Revert specific commit(s)**
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

**Option 3: Redeploy previous tag**
```bash
git checkout <previous-tag>
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app --target-org msb-sbox
```

### Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits:

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no functional change)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat(wizard): Add handler map pattern to persistence service`

---

## 🚫 Guardrails (Do NOT do these)

- Do NOT commit directly to `main` branch - always use feature branches
- Do NOT create overlapping objects/fields - search `force-app/main/default/objects/` first
- Do NOT invent answers to open questions - ask the user
- Do NOT build non-essential automation in Phase 1
- Do NOT commit PII to logs, debug statements, or sample files
- Do NOT use incorrect object names (Loan__c, Business_Relationship__c, etc.)

---

## 🔒 Invariants (Do NOT break these)

- Use FSC objects where they exist; create customs only for separation of concerns
- Every FinancialAccount (loan) must link to an Account and identify Applicants via FinancialAccountRole
- Use External ID fields for idempotent upserts (DAOApplicationId__c, etc.)
- PII fields (SSN, DOB) must be protected with FLS and encryption
- ApplicationForm is the master record for applications; Applicant is master-detail to ApplicationForm
